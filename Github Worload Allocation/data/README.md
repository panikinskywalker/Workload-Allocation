## Usage

This dataset is designed to be used with the Faculty Workload Allocation System optimization algorithms:

1. **Load the dataset** using `data_loader.py`
2. **Apply optimization algorithms** (Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing)
3. **Validate constraints** and workload balancing
4. **Generate allocation reports** and visualizations

## Data Generation

The dataset was generated using `src/dataset_generator.py` with:
- **Random seed**: 42 (for reproducibility)
- **Realistic parameters**: Based on academic workload models
- **Balanced distribution**: Across departments and difficulty levels
- **Team teaching support**: Realistic sharing capabilities

## Constraints

### Hard Constraints
- Every course must be allocated to at least the minimum required professors
- Every professor must have at least the minimum teaching load
- No professor can exceed the maximum teaching load
- Course professor limits must be respected

### Soft Constraints
- Fairness in workload distribution across faculty
- Expertise matching between professors and courses
- Preference satisfaction for course assignments
- Minimize team teaching when single professor is sufficient
